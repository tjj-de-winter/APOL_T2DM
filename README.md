# APOL_T2DM
This repository includes the merging of four published scRNA-seq datasets of human pancreatic islets of non-diabetic (ND) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) organ donors. 
We applied this combined datasets to shed light on the gene expression patterns of the APOL gene family in ND and T2DM pancreatic cells.
The merged dataset includes the following datasets: SMART-seq (Wang et al., GSE83139; and Xin et al., GSE81608) and SMART-seq2 (Enge et al. GSE81547; and Segerstolpe et al. E-MTAB-5061).

The repository contains the scripts and jupyter notebooks for the generation of the dataset as well as gene expression analysis.
